Early Detection Saves Lives: A Data-Driven Approach
Breast cancer diagnosis is one of the most impactful applications of machine learning in healthcare. In my recent project, I explored different models to classify malignant and benign cases with higher accuracy.

What I Did:
Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset, converting categorical labels into numerical values.

Used K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to classify tumors.

Compared model performance to find the most effective approach.

Key Learning:
Each model has its strengthsâ€”while KNN works well with smaller datasets, Decision Trees provide interpretability, and Random Forest improves accuracy by reducing overfitting. The right choice depends on the balance between precision and computational efficiency.

Why It Matters:
Early and accurate detection of breast cancer can save lives. By leveraging machine learning, we can assist healthcare professionals in making faster and more reliable diagnoses.
